# Quiz Generator - Technical Doc

## Overview

I created a web app that allows users to generate quizzes based on provided text content. It uses AI to analyze the text and create relevant multiple-choice questions, with the ability to customize the number of questions. Users can take the quiz, receive immediate feedback, and export their results as a Word document.

## Architecture

The application is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. The key components include:

### Frontend

- **React Components**: Modular UI components for different parts of the application
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Client-side State Management**: Using React's useState and useEffect hooks

### Backend

- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for handling API requests
- **Groq API Integration**: For AI-powered quiz generation
- **Document Generation**: Using docx library for Word document export
